# About
This is my ZMK config for the [Corax54](https://github.com/dnlbauer/corax-keyboard/) keyboard. It employs a [Seeed XIAO BLE nRF52840](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_BLE/) as a central device/dongle, using the nice!nano boards in each keyboard half as peripherals.

# Usage
Github actions are not supported, use `make all` to build UF2 files.
